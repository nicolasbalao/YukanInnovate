## DOCS

- BehaviorSubject ==> Requires an initial value and emits the current value to new subscribers
  If you want the last emitted value(s) on subscription, but do not need to supply a seed value, check out ReplaySubject instead!


- Injectable ==> Decorator that marks a class as available to be provided and injected as a dependency.

- $ after var ==> The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.
